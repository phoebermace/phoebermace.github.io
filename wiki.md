The Patagotitan Mayorum, is one species of the Titanosauria, thought to be the largest land animal to have ever roamed the Earth. Living around 100 million years ago in the Patagonia, where current day Argentina is. 


## Discovery
With a more recent discovery of 2010, the Patogititan fossils were discovered when part of a suspicially large femur bone was found by an Argentinian farmer. Following this discovery, archaelogists began a dig that would result in more than 200 fossils being uncovered. All together the bones were estimated to come from six of the same species of dinosaur, the Patogititan that had all lived around 100 million years ago.

## Description
Patagotitan was a particularly large and robust titanosaur. It can be distinguished from its close relatives by a suite of unique characteristics in its back and tail vertebrae, scapulae and humeri in the forelimb, and ischia and femora in the hindlimb. Among these was the presence of accessory vertebral articulations known as the hyposphene-hypantrum articulations, which was likely a weight-bearing adaptation not seen in any other genome.
#### Size
In 2014, news reports provided estimates of Patagotitan's size at 40 m (131 ft) long with a weight of 77 tonnes (85 short tons), when compared to the average eliphant which comes out to 2-7 tons, which puts the size into perspective.

#### Diet
They were herbivorous animals like their closest relatives and had teeth perfect for stripping vegetation off the branches. Assuming with their heights that these branches would be quite high, the climate at the time was forrested as multiple coniferous plant fossils were found at the site.
